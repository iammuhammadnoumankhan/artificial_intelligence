# Predict Ethereum Price using LSTM

## Overview
This project explores Ethereum's price trends over an extensive period, from 2016 to 2024. And forecast the prices for next 7 days.It includes data analysis, visualization, and LSTM model training and prediction.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing.
- Ethereum price visualization using Python.
- Insights into Ethereum's historical performance.
- Training LSTM model.
- Price Forecasting for next 7 days.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and visualization code.
- `images/`: Visualizations and graphs generated from the data inside notebooks.

## Requirements
